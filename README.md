# weather-dashboard

## Description
For this assignment, our instructor asked us to use the city url and display the data by api url. In addition, the UV index is not available in the free version, and the lat and lon values are not working either, so neither of those are present on the webpage.

## User Story

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
